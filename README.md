This is a simple program for a study guide creator! People can use this to create their own study guide and quiz themsleves. To run the code, copy the contents of the main.Studyguidecreator
file and run it in a online complier or IDE. If you run it in a IDE, download Python on your computer. Run the code and answer the questions that it asks you. First, it will ask you how many
questions that you would like to have. As of 12/24/25, it only supports up to 21 questions. Then, it will ask you what the questions should be. After that, it will ask you what the answers to those
questions should be. Then, it will ask you the questions that you entered. If you get it correct, (if you write the exact same thing that you entered earlier), it will tell you and give you a
point. If you get it wrong, it will tell you and will give you the correct answer. Keep in mind that when giving the answers to the questions that you gave, make them all capitalized or
lowercase and do the same thing when answering them. (It's case-sensitive). At the end, it will give you your score (how many questions you got correct.)
